contents[66]='Microwave-Safe UtensilsOvenproof Glass: Glassware  that is heat-resistant is microwave-safe. This would include all brands of  oven tempered glass utensils. However, do not use delicate glassware, such as  tumblers or wine glasses, as these might shatter as the food warms.Pottery  Stoneware Ceramic: Use   bowls, cups, serving plates, pottery, stoneware, ceramic, and platters   without metallic rim. Many containers made of these materials are microwave-safe, but test them  before use.PlasticPlastic Storage Containers: These can be used to hold foods that are to be quickly reheated. However,  they should not be used to hold foods that will need considerable time in the  oven as hot foods will eventually warp or melt plastic containers.Plastic Cooking Bags: Provided they are specially made for cooking, cooking bags are microwave  safe. Remember to make a slit in the bag so that steam can escape. Never use  ordinary plastic bags for cooking in the microwave oven, as they will melt  and rupture. Plastic Microwave Utensils: A variety of shapes and sizes of microwave utensils are available. You may  be able to use items you already have on hand rather than investing in new  kitchen equipment.Paper: Use paper towels, waxed paper, paper napkins, and paper plates with no metallic  rim or design. Paper plates and containers are convenient and safe to use in  the microwave oven, provided that the cooking time is short and foods to be  cooked are low in fat and moisture. Paper towels are also very useful for  wrapping foods and for lining baking trays in which greasy foods such as  bacon are cooked. In general, avoid coloured paper products as the color may  run. Some recycled paper products may contain impurities which could cause  arcing or fires when used in the microwave.Tableware: Many   containers made of pottery, stoneware and ceramic are also microwave-safe.  If  in doubt consult the manufacturer’s literature or perform the microwave  test. Do not put plates with painted decoration in the oven, as the paint may  contain metal and cause arcing.';

contents[67]='Microwave-Unsafe Utensils Metal   Containers and Metal DecorationNever use  metal or metal-rimmed  utensils in the microwave oven. Microwaves  cannot penetrate metal. They will bounce off any metal object in  the oven and  cause arcing, an alarming phenomenon that resembles  lightning. Metal shields  the food from microwave energy and produces uneven cooking.  Also avoid metal  skewers, thermometers, foil trays, metal-rimmed or  metal-banded dinnerware,  casserole dishes, etc. The metal rim interferes with  normal cooking and may damage the oven.';

However, some utensils may contain materials that are not suitable for microwave use. Follow the steps below to find out if utensils can be used in the microwave.Place the container in question and a glass measuring cup filled with water next to each other inside the oven. Heat the container and glass measuring cup for 1 minute at HIGH power.If the water heats up but the container remains cool to the press, the container is microwave-safe.If the temperature of the water does not change but the container becomes warm, it is not safe for use in the microwave oven.Some items with high lead or iron content are not suitable for microwave cooking.Utensils should be checked to ensure that it is suitable for use in the microwave.Always be careful when taking utensils out of the oven.

title[70]='Cooking Tips';
contents[70]='Cooking TipsCarefully monitor the food in the microwave oven when it is cooked. Directions given in recipes to elevate, stir, etc., are the minimum steps recommended. If the food seems to be cooked unevenly, simply make the necessary adjustments to correct the problem.Covering: Cover the plate with a lid, parchment paper (not waxed paper) or cling plastic wrap for use in the microwave oven. A cover traps heat and steam, which help to cook the food more quickly.Stirring: Stir from the outside towards the center, as food at the outside of the dish heats more quickly.Standing Time: Standing time allows foods to finish cooking and also helps flavors blend and develop. Foods are often allowed to stand for 3 to 10 minutes after being removed from the oven. Cooking Time: Set the cooking time according to the temperature of the ingredients. Ice-cold ingredients take considerably longer to cook than room temperature ingredients.Sprinkling: Low-moisture foods such as roasts and vegetables should be sprinkled with water before cooking or covered to retain moisture.Arranging: The upper portion of thick foods will be cooked more quickly than the lower portion. Turn food over several times during cooking.Piercing: Pierce foods that are enclosed in a shell, skin or membrane before cooking to prevent them from bursting.Such foods include yolks and whites of eggs, clams, oysters, potatoes, and other whole vegetables and fruits.Shape of Food: Microwaves penetrate only about 2 cm into food. Only the outer edge of food is cooked by microwave energy; the rest is cooked as the heat moves inward.Place the thickest portions of foods like meat, poultry or fish toward the outside of the utensils to help them cook more evenly.If possible, shape foods into thin rounds or rings.Density: Light, porous food such as cakes and breads are cooked more quickly than heavy, dense foods such as roasts and casseroles. Bones and Fat: Bones conduct heat and fat cooks more quickly than meat. Take care with bony or fatty cuts of meat.Quantity: The more food you place in the oven, the longer the required cooking time.Shielding: Cover the corners of square dishes with strips of aluminum foil to prevent overcooking. Do not use too much foil, and make sure the foil is secured to the dish. If the foil gets too close to the oven walls during cooking, it can cause arcing.';

Either the light bulb has blown or the electric circuit has failed.Q: Does microwave energy pass through the viewing screen in the door?A: No. The holes, or ports, are made to allow light to pass; they do not let microwave energy through.Q: Why does the beep tone sound when a button on the control panel is touched?A: The beep tone sounds to assure that the setting is being properly entered.Q: Will the microwave function be damaged if it operates empty?A: Yes. Never run it empty.Q: Why do eggs sometimes pop?A: When baking, frying, or poaching eggs, the yolk may pop due to steam build up inside the yolk membrane. To prevent this, simply pierce the yolk before cooking. Never microwave eggs in the shell.Q: Why is standing time recommended after microwave cooking is over?A: After microwave cooking is finished, food keeps on cooking during standing time. This standing time finishes cooking evenly throughout the food. the amount of standing time depends on the density of the food.Q: Why doesn’t my oven always cook as fast as the cooking guide says?A:Check your cooking guide again to make sure you have followed directions correctly, and to see what might cause variations in cooking time.Cooking guide times and heat settings are suggestions, chosen to help prevent overcooking, the most common problem in getting used to this oven.Variations in the size, shape, weight and dimensions of the food require longer cooking time.Use your own judgment along with the cooking guide suggestions to test food conditions, just as you would do with a conventional cooker.';
